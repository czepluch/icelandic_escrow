/**
 * Step 4: Bonus Challenges - Advanced Escrow Features
 *
 * This contract extends the basic escrow with production-ready features.
 * All function signatures are provided - implement the logic to make tests pass!
 *
 * Features to Implement:
 * 1. Timeout Mechanism - Automatic refunds if seller doesn't deliver
 * 2. Partial Payments - Support multiple deposits
 * 3. Fee Collection - Arbiter earns fees for dispute resolution
 * 4. Multiple Arbiters - Voting system for decentralized arbitration
